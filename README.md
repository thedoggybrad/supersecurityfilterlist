## What is Raw, Subscribe and CDNs?
This section is just an additional information about those options. Since not all the people know what are those terms.
<br>
<br>
•Raw - It is a raw text file you can add to your adblock.

<br>
•CDNs - It stands for Content Delivery Network and they are used to distribute a file or an entire website faster to multiple people, location and devices with the help of a cache (copy of the file in other servers) and that cache is stored on multiple servers by the CDN provider.
<br>
